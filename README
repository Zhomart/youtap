The reason for giving the link in double-quotes is that sometimes the link contain '&'(ampersand), which the UNIX interprets as "run the program in background"


Sundar Srinivasan's version doesn't work when I tested on 8 august 2011.

There is no fmt_url_map string in `content` and urllib2.unqote() doesn't decode percent encoded url (I dunno why)
But there is fmt_stream_map string in `content` and I added urllib2.url2pathname() to decode url
