Python project to download YouTube video from command line

Author: Sundar Srinivasan, Twitter: @krishnasun

Usage: python youtap.py "<link-to-youtube-video-page>"

The reason for giving the link in double-quotes is that sometimes the link contain '&'(ampersand), which the UNIX interprets as "run the program in background"
